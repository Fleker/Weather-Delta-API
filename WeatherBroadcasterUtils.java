/**
 * Created by N on 6/2/2015.
 * This class is meant to be a simple way for Android apps to interact with Weather Delta for the sake of
 * getting simple weather data in their app without having to program any complex code.
 *
 * ## Pros
 * * All of the download management is managed in the background, you don't need to code it
 * * There is no need to request the user's location or Internet
 * * Most recent data is cached, giving you data instantly, even when offline
 * * As Weather Delta continues to evolve, your app also improves without any extra work
 * * User customization is handled by the Weather Delta app, like metric and download settings,
 * so you don't need to rewrite the wheel
 * * Many weather services have prices per API call online. As the data is cached on this device,
 * there is no cost to you to implement this, it's merely extending data already available.
 * * All of the data parsing is already handled. Getting the temperature is one simple method.
 * There's also richer weather information in the summaries.
 * * l18n for weather data is already built-in
 * * Weather Delta is available on Android phones, tablets, TVs, and Wear. Your app can access this
 * API on all devices. (The Wear app currently doesn't support this API, so you'll have to get the
 * data from the mobile app)
 *
 * ## Cons
 * * Users will need to have Weather Delta installed on their device in order for this API to work.
 * Use `isAppInstalled` to check whether these APIs can be used.
